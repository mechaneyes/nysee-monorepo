              When it became clear <Link href="/gossamer">Gossamer</Link>{" "}
              wasn&apos;t going to print, I backed out and leveraged some
              Illustrator files I&apos;ve been wanting to use. The repeated
              shape is a single character from the{" "}

            <p>
              One thing I like about working in Illustrator is that I can
              randomly apply colors to elements using the Recolor Artwork tool.
              I can load up a colorway and then just run and re-run until I find
              something I like.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once settled on the resulting composition, I paste the vector
              elements into Photoshop, breaking each color&apos;s elements into
              their own layer for arrangement, further post, then on to print.

            <p>
              In order to print the text in it&apos;s full, uninturpted Violet
              color, I created trapping by punching through the lower two layers
              before printing Violet last. Alignment was a bit of a challenge,
              but I got several to print well.
            </p>
            <p>
              Directly above you can see that the final, Violet, layer was still
              a bit off. Further tweaking within the Riso allowed me to achieve

              The edges of the text are a bit saturated. This is because when in
              creating the trapping, one typically shrinks the selection
              that&apos;s cut by a couple pixels, thereby allowing the element
              to entirely fill and cover the lower, earlier layers.

              Pretty happy with this, though you can see from the bottom left of
              the sheet that the layers aren&apos;t quite in perfect alignment.
              I&apos;m good with this.

              I&apos;m not sure what I was doing that produced such saturated
              reds. This wouldn&apos;t have been reflected in the same way once
              printed, so I backed out and reworked the file into the directions
              you see above.
